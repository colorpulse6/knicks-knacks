# Implementation Plan
## Rule Type: Agent Requested

This rule defines a repeatable, multi-phase plan for implementing new apps within the monorepo. It provides structure and consistency for creating high-quality, full-stack applications using the shared architecture, tech stack, and design rules already defined.

When requested, agents should follow these phases:

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Scaffold the App

- Create new directory under `/apps/<app-name>`
- If applicable, create the following subdirs:
  - `/web`: Next.js or Vite web client
  - `/mobile`: Expo-managed React Native app
  - `/backend`: Express or tRPC API
  - `/tests`: Integration/E2E tests
- Add app-specific `README.md` and `package.json`
- Set up `.env` for local dev
- Register the app in `turbo.json` if needed

---

## 🧱 Phase 2: Database & Auth

- Create a **dedicated Supabase project** for the app
- Design schema using Supabase Studio or SQL migration
- Set up Supabase Auth (email + password or OAuth)
- Configure `.env` with Supabase keys

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Backend Development

- Create Express or tRPC server in `/backend`
- Set up routes, controllers, services, and middleware
- Add JWT validation using Supabase auth
- Integrate with Supabase DB using Supabase JS client

---

## 🎨 Phase 4: Frontend Development

- Scaffold UI using `/packages/ui` components
- Integrate Supabase client
- Use **TanStack Query** for all data fetching
- Implement responsive layout and dark mode

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing

- Unit test shared logic with **Vitest**
- Component test UI with **Testing Library**
- Use **Playwright** for E2E (web) or **Detox** (mobile)
- Confirm linting passes with `/packages/eslint-config`

---

## 🚀 Phase 6: Deployment

- Web: Deploy to **Vercel**
- Backend: Deploy to **Railway**
- Mobile:
  - OTA updates via Expo
  - Optional: use **EAS Build** for app store deployment

---

## 🛠 Phase 7: Docs, Monitoring & Cleanup

- Add screenshots/GIFs to `README.md`
- Describe tech stack, setup, and deployment
- Optional: Add Sentry for error monitoring
- Confirm all rules from `/rules/` are followed
