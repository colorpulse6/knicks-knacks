# Leaf Setup Automation
## Rule Type: Agent Requested

**How to Use:**
Use this rule when setting up or updating the Supabase project for Leaf. Follow each step to ensure consistent database and local environment setup.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Install Supabase CLI
If not already installed:
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

---

## 🗂 Step 2: Initialize Supabase Locally
Inside `/apps/leaf/`:
```bash
supabase init
```
Creates `/supabase` with `/migrations` and `config.toml`.  
Commit this directory to version control.

---

## ✍️ Step 3: Add Database Schema
Generate a migration file and paste in the schema from `data-models.mdc`:
```bash
supabase migration new init-schema
```
Paste your schema into the generated file under `/supabase/migrations`.  
Keep this in sync with `data-models.mdc`.

---

## 🏃 Step 4: Run Local Supabase
Start Supabase locally for development:
```bash
supabase start
```

---

## 🔗 Step 5: Link Remote Project (Optional)
If deploying, link to the remote Supabase project:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

---

## ✅ Finalize
- Ensure all migrations are applied locally and remotely
- Confirm all `.env` files are present and correct
- Ready for development!
