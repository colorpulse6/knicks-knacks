# Architecture Rules
## Rule Type: Always

- Use **monorepo** structure clearly organized by `apps` and `packages` directories.

```
/apps
  /<app-name>
    /web         # Web frontend (Next.js or Vite)
    /mobile      # Mobile frontend (Expo/React Native)
    /backend     # Express-based API
    /tests       # App-specific tests

/packages
  /ui            # Shared UI components (cross-platform: React + RN)
  /eslint-config # Central ESLint rules
  /utilities     # Common utilities
  /shared        # Common hooks, types
  /config        # Shared TS config, Tailwind config, PostCSS, etc.
  ```

- All apps are self-contained and deployable.
- Shared packages are reused across apps.
- Each app must have a `README.md`, `package.json`, and local `.env` file.
- Backend folders may use REST or tRPC, with JWT auth (via Supabase).
- All web and mobile clients use TanStack Query for data fetching.
- Each shared package must be typed and versioned locally.
